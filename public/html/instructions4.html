    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully </h1>
    <div id="instructions">
        As mentioned, you will play four rounds in Stage Two. Each of these rounds is completely independent from the others, and you will start
        each round again with the same wealth and contribution to
    climate risk.  The first round is <strong> PRACTICE </strong>. The subsequent
        three rounds will be used in the experiment.
        At the end of the game, you will receive your remaining
    endowment from one of the latter three rounds in addition to
        your fixed show-up fee. The payout round is randomly selected at the end of the game.
        Your pay is calculated by the following conversion: 50 ECU is equal to 1 USD.
        <br />
        <br/>
        After the game, there will be a short questionnaire. You need to finish the questionnaire in order to get the exit code. There is a bonus question in the questionnaire which will be added to your payout from the experiment. 
        <br/>
        Please note that you can look at these instructions at any point in the game.
