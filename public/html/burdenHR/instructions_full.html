    <h1>Instructions of the experiment.</h1>
    <div id="instructions">
        In this game we will simulate climate change negotiations. The large majoriy of scientists agrees that the main cause
        for global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, especially CO<sub>2</sub>. Each unit of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted has the same effect
        on the Earth’s climate, regardless of where it has been emitted. If global warming continues unchecked, there are likely
        to be catastrophic consequences that lead to heavy economic damage and human suffering.
        <br />
        <br />
        The problem is that reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to avoid dangerous climate change is costly. These costs have to be shared
        somehow among countries and individuals.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the game we will use “Experimental Currency Units” (ECU). Within groups of two players, you will have to negotiate
        how to share the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The total cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is 10 ECU.
        <br />
        <br />
        In every group, one player will be the “proposer”, and one player the “responder”. Each player starts a round with 30 ECU
        in his/her account. First, the proposer will be asked how much of the total cost she/he offers to pay. This offer has to
        be a whole number between 0 and 10. After that, the responder will be asked whether she/he accepts or rejects the offer.
        If the responder accepts, a climate agreement has been concluded: each player’s share of the cost is subtracted from his/her
        account.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no costs have to be paid. However, with a probability of 50% a climate
        catastrophe will occur. In that case, each player loses half of their endowment. Whether this catastrophe occurs is determined
        randomly by the computer.
        <br />
        <br />
        You will play three rounds of the game. The rounds will be identical, except that your role (proposer or responder) can change,
        and you will play with a different participant in each round. At the end of the game, you will receive your remaining endowment
        from one of the three rounds. Which round will be paid out is randomly selected by the
        computer at the end of the game. You will receive 10 cents per 1 ECU.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the game there will be a short questionnaire. Your payment does not depend on your answers in the questionnaire.
        <br />

        <h2><b><font color="red">Attention</font></b></h2>
        Please stick to the following rules during the experiment.
        <ul>
            <li>Always follow the instructions on the screen.</li>
            <li>Do not use the "Back Button" of your browser during the experiment.</li>
            <li>If you by mistake used the "Back Button" please follow the instructions on the opening page and click the "Continue" button.</li>
            <li>If your browser crashes you have 60 seconds to reconnect, otherwise the experiment will be terminated.
                For reconnecting open the page again. You may now copy the internet adress you can see in the adress bar of your browser.</li>
        </ul>
        If you do not follow these rules we are unable to pay you out.
