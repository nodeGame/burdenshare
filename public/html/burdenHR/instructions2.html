        There will be two parts of the game. Part One consists of five rounds. In each round, you will decide whether you want <b>high, medium, or
        low growth</b> in your economy. All levels of growth will increase your wealth. However, the exact amount is uncertain and can be
        any number between the following ranges.

        <b>The economic growth in your economy will contribute to climate risk.</b> Climate risk is the probability with which you can lose a part of your
        wealth due to a climate catastrophe in the second part of the experiment. Your climate risk will increase depending on your economic growth as follows:
