    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully </h1>
    <div id="instructions">
        In Part Two, you will play a total of four rounds with each round following the same format. Each round will be played against one other participant.
        In every pair, there will be one “proposer” and a “responder”. Anyone can be a “responder” or a “proposer”. These roles are randomly assigned to each player every round.
        You will start each of the four rounds with the accumulated wealth and climate risk from the first part. The wealth amongst players ranges between 30
        (low economic growth) and 125 ECU (high economic growth). Your contribution to climate risk can be between 0 and 25 percent with those who had higher
        economic growth in the past having larger contributions to climate risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the start of each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the total cost she/he offers to pay.
        This offer has to be a whole number between 0 and <font id="cost"></font>. After that, the responder will be asked whether
        she/he accepts or rejects the offer. If the responder accepts and a climate agreement has been reach
        then each player’s share of the cost is subtracted from his/her wealth.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no costs have to be paid. However, there is a risk
        that a climate catastrophe will occur. This risk is the sum of both players’ contribution to climate
        risk plus a baseline risk of 15 percent that means climate
    risk is between 15% and 65%. If a catastrophe happens,
        each player loses half of his or her wealth. The computer randomly determines whether the catastrophe occurs.
