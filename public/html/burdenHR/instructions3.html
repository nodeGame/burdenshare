        In Stage Two, you will play <strong>four rounds</strong>. Each
        round will be played against one other participant either in
        the role of a <strong>"proposer"</strong> or in the role of
        a <strong>"responder"</strong>. These roles are randomly
        assigned to each player every round.

        <br />
        <br />
        
        You will start each round with the accumulated wealth and
    climate risk from the first stage. The wealth amongst players
    ranges between 30 (e.g. low growth) and 125 ECU (e.g. high
    growth). Players contribution to overall climate risk can be
    between 0 and 25 percent. Remember that those who had higher
    economic growth in the past will have larger contributions to
    climate risk.

        <br />
        <br />

        In each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the
        total cost she/he offers to pay. This offer has to be an
        integer number between 0 and <font id="cost"></font>. After
        that, the responder will be asked whether she/he accepts or
        rejects the offer. 

        <br />
        <br />

        If the responder <strong>accepts</strong>, a climate agreement has been reached
        and each player's share of the cost is subtracted from his/her
        wealth.

        <br />
        <br />

        If the responder <strong>rejects</strong>, there is no
    agreement and no costs have to be paid. However, there is a risk
    that a climate catastrophe will occur. This risk is the sum of
    both players' contribution to climate risk plus a baseline risk of
    15 percent that means climate risk is between 15% and 65%.

        <br />
        <br />

        If a catastrophe happens <strong>each player loses half of his
    or her wealth</strong>. The computer randomly determines whether a
    catastrophe occurs in case of no agreement.
