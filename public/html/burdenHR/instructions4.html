        You will play four rounds in Part Two. Each of these rounds is completely independent from the others, and you will start
        each round again with the same wealth and contribution to
    climate risk.  The first round is <strong> PRACTICE </strong>. The subsequent
        three rounds will be used in the experiment.
        At the end of the game, you will receive your remaining endowment from one of the last three rounds (in addition to
        your fixed show-up fee). Which round will be paid out is randomly selected by the computer at the end of the game.
        For your payout, with 50 ECU equal to 1 USD.
        <br />

        After the game, there will be a short questionnaire. Your payment does not depend on your answers in the
        questionnaire. Please note that you can look at these instructions at any point in the game.
