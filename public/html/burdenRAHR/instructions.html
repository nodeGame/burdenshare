In this game, we will simulate climate change negotiations. The large majority of scientists agree that the main cause of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Each unit of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted has the same effect on the Earth’s climate regardless of where it has been emitted. If global warming continues unchecked, there could be catastrophic consequences leading to heavy economic damage and human suffering.
        <br />
        <br />
One of the major obstacles to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> is its cost and deciding how to share these costs amongst countries and individuals. In this experiment, you will negotiate how to share the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the game, we will use “Experimental Currency Units” (ECU). The total cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is <font id="cost"></font> ECU.
