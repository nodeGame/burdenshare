<h1>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully</h1>

    <div id="instructions">
You will play a total of four rounds. Each round follows the same
      format. In each round of the experiment, you will play against a
      different person
      participating in the experiment. One of you will be randomly
      assigned the role of “proposer” and the other will randomly be
      assigned the role of "responder". At the beginning of the round,
      you will learn the wealth of your one-person economy. The wealth amongst players ranges between 30 and 125 ECU reflecting different rates of economic growth in the past.  
        <br />
        <br />
At the start of each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the
      total cost they are willing to pay. This offer has to be a whole
      number between 0 and <font id="cost"></font>. After that, the
      responder will be asked whether they accept or reject the
      offer. If the responder accepts and a climate agreement has been
      reached, then each player's share of the cost is subtracted from
      their overall wealth.
        <br />
        <br />
If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no payments are made. However, there is a risk that a climate catastrophe will
    occur. Both players contribute to a potential climate
      catastrophe. <strong> The
      past economic growth in your one-person economy determines your
      contribution to climate risk. </strong> Players can increase the
      probability of a climate catastrophe between 0 to 25
      percent. The overall risk is the sum of both players
      contribution plus a baseline risk of 15 percent. At the start of
      each round, you will
      learn your contribution to climate risk, the other player's
      contribution, and the added overall climate risk.  <font
    color="red"> If a catastrophe happens, each player looses half of
      their wealth.</font> The game will randomly determine whether a
      catastrophe occurs in the cases of non-agreement.
