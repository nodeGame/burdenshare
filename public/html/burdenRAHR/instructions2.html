    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully</h1>
    <div id="instructions">
You will play a total of four rounds. Each round follows the same format. In each round, you will play against another person participating in the experiment. One of you will be randomly assigned the role of “proposer” and the other will randomly be assigned the role of “responder”. At the beginning of the round, you will also learn the wealth of your one-person economy and the risk of a catastrophic climate event.  If a catastrophic climate event occurs, you will lose half of your wealth. The wealth amongst players ranges between 30 and 125 ECU, reflecting different rates of economic growth in the past.  
        <br />
        <br />
At the start of each round, the proposer will be asked how much of the total cost she/he offers to pay. This offer has to be an integer number between 0 and <font id="cost"></font>. After that, the responder will be asked whether she/he accepts or rejects the offer. If the responder accepts and a climate agreement has been reached, then each player’s share of the cost is subtracted from his/her wealth.
        <br />
        <br />
If the responder rejects, there is no agreement and no costs have to
    be paid. However, there is a risk that a climate catastrophe will
    occur. The total risk is the sum of both players’ contribution to
    climate risk plus a baseline risk of 15 percent. Your contribution
    to climate risk can be between 0 and 25 percent. This means the
    total climate risk is between 15% and 65%. <strong> Note that the past economic growth in your one-person economy determines your contribution to climate risk. </strong> If you have higher wealth due to higher economic growth in the past, your contribution to climate risk will tend to be higher. If a catastrophe happens, each player loses half of his or her wealth. The computer randomly determines whether the catastrophe occurs.
