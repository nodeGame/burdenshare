<h1>INSTRUCTIONS: Please read carefully</h1>
<br />
<br />
    <div id="instructions">
        You will play four rounds. Each of these rounds is completely independent from the others, and you will start each
        round with the same wealth and contribution to climate
      risk.
<br />
<br />
      You will start with a <b>PRACTICE</b> round. This will not be
      included in the experiment. Each part of the
      round will be explained. The subsequent
      three rounds will be used in the experiment. If you have
      questions in these rounds, you can access these instructions at
      any time by clicking on the button at the bottom of the screen
      labeled "Click here to show or hide the instructions".
<br />
<br />  
        At the end of the game, <b>you will be paid your remaining
      endowment from one of the three rounds of the experiment</b> in addition to
        the fixed show-up fee. The payout round is randomly selected by the computer at the end of the game.
        The conversion rate is 50 ECU to 1 USD.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the game, there will be a short questionnaire. Your payment does not depend on your answers in the questionnaire.
        <br />

            <li>If your browser crashes, you have 60 seconds to
